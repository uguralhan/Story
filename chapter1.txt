it was the best of times, it was the worst of time.

on git we used those command:
git init
ls -a
git status
git commit-m "Complete Chapter1"
git log
git add . (more than one files add in a short way)


working directory to staging area we use (git add)

From staging area to local repository we use ( git commit)

From local repository to working directory we use (git checkout)

So when you changed your file accidently, you can check file with (git diff "filename") then (git checkout "filename") take you back to previous version of your file.

(git log) check your documents commits

and if you want to publish on gitHub your docs you use git remote add "name of remote ex. origin" then gitHub address

(ex. git remote add oirign1 https://github.com/uguralhan/Story.git)

then git push -u origin master (master is name of branch/default brach/main branch)

when new brach added on gitHub, we use git branch alien-port(branch name up to you)
if you wanna check how many branches you have type ( git branch)
then when you want to switch branches we use (git checkout main or alien-plot(these are your branches name))
