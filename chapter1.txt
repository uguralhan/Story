it was the best of times, it was the worst of time.

on git we used those command:
git init
ls -a
git status
git commit-m "Complete Chapter1"
git log
git add . (more than one files add in a short way)


working directory to staging area we use (git add)

From staging area to local repository we use ( git commit)

From local repository to working directory we use (git checkout)

So when you changed your file accidently, you can check file with (git diff "filename") then (git checkout "filename") take you back to previous version of your file.
